Typically, the information in scope for this IG are [patient sensitive](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#Patient). This IG SHOULD be used in combination with a [Privacy and Security Framework](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#http) and risk assessment based on the FHIR Security Module, which provides guidance to support [Communications](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#http), [Authentication](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#authentication), [Authorization](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#binding), [Privacy Consent](http://hl7.org/fhir/secpriv-module.html#privacy-consent), [Audit Logging](http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html#audit), [Provenance](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/us-security-label-regs/branches/master/secpriv-module.html#provenance), etc.
